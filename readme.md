## Introduction

This is my analysis into the [Fisher's Iris Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris), using the python language.


## What is the Data Set?

The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species. The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.[1]


The first main study was by Edgar Anderson whom collected data on 3 different irise species on the Gaspé Peninsula, Quebec, Canada. Anderson collected the data in a journal which is called The Irises of the Gaspe Peninsula which was published in October 1935. [2]
